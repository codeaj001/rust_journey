# Rust Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **Rust Learning Journey** repository! Here, I'll be tracking my path to mastering Rust, from the basics all the way to advanced concepts. This repository will hold all my exercises, projects, and code snippets as I explore the language and push myself towards becoming proficient in Rust.

## 🌱 About This Repository

This repository is designed to:
- Document my progress and learning from Rust beginner fundamentals to advanced topics.
- Store all the exercises, mini-projects, and challenges I tackle.
- Serve as a resource for anyone interested in tracking their own Rust learning path or seeing practical applications of Rust concepts.

### 🛠️ What You’ll Find Here

- **Exercises**: Simple and intermediate Rust exercises designed to reinforce core concepts.
- **Projects**: Small and progressively complex projects that put theory into practice.
- **Code Snippets**: Useful code snippets or algorithms written in Rust for reference.
- **Learning Notes**: Key takeaways and notes from my study sessions, organized by topic.

## 📝 Repository Structure

Here's how the repository is structured:

```plaintext

## 🌍 Why Rust?

Rust is known for its memory safety, performance, and modern tooling, making it perfect for systems programming, WebAssembly, and even some web development scenarios. My goal is to deeply understand Rust’s unique features and its approach to memory safety, concurrency, and systems-level programming.

## 🚧 Current Progress

Check the repository’s commit history to follow my journey step-by-step. I’m constantly adding new exercises, refining projects, and expanding my knowledge base here.
